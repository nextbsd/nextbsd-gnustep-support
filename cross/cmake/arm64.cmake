# cross/cmake/arm64.cmake — CMake cross toolchain for nextbsd-gnustep-support, T=arm64.
#
# Same shape as nextbsd-userland's cmake/cross-arm64.cmake, beside the meson and
# autotools files in cross/ (Source-Repo-Conventions): cmake and ninja run
# on the x86_64 Linux runner and drive the pinned clang/lld 19.1.7 from
# $CROSS_BINDIR, emitting NextBSD/arm64 objects against $SYSROOT.
#
# Required environment (exported by build-gnustep-support.sh):
#   CROSS_BINDIR  the toolchain image's clang, clang++, ld.lld, llvm-ar ...
#   SYSROOT       the staged NextBSD base, with every earlier component of
#                 this repo installed into its /usr
#
# CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME is FreeBSD: NextBSD's base is FreeBSD's libc and ABI, so
# the upstream FreeBSD code paths are the right ones.
